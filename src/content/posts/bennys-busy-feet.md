**Benny’s Busy Feet**

One bright morning, Benny woke up feeling a little wiggly. His feet kept tapping on the bed, and his toes wiggled under the blankets. "Why are my feet so busy today?" Benny wondered.

He hopped out of bed, and as soon as his feet touched the floor, they started moving all by themselves! First, they wiggled left, then right, then... *boing*! Benny bounced right into the hallway.

"Whoa! My feet are really busy today!" Benny giggled. He rushed to the kitchen, where his mom was making breakfast.

"Good morning, Benny," she said with a smile. "It looks like you have busy feet today."

"Yeah, Mom! They keep moving and I can’t stop them!" Benny laughed as he hopped from one foot to the other.

"Maybe they want some exercise," his mom said, placing a plate of pancakes on the table.

Benny’s eyes lit up. "Exercise? What’s that?"

"Exercise is when you move your body to get strong and healthy. It’s also fun!"

Benny thought for a moment, then looked down at his feet. "Hmm... maybe my busy feet *do* want some fun."

After breakfast, Benny decided to test his busy feet. First, he ran outside to the yard. "Let’s see how fast we can go!" he shouted, and off he ran, his feet flying over the grass. *Whoosh!* He ran in circles, zigzagging around, faster and faster, until he was out of breath. Benny flopped down on the grass and laughed. "That was fun!"

Just then, his friend Ella came over. "Hey, Benny! What are you doing?"

Benny grinned. "My feet are super busy today, and I’m giving them some exercise!"

"Exercise? That sounds fun! Can I join?"

"Of course! Let’s see who can jump the highest!"

Benny and Ella lined up side by side. "One, two, three... JUMP!" Benny jumped, and then Ella jumped. Up and down, up and down they went, their feet springing off the ground. Benny's feet felt lighter and bouncier with each jump, and his laugh got louder and louder.

"Whee! Look how high we can go!" Benny cheered.

Ella giggled. "It’s like we're kangaroos!"

They kept jumping until their legs felt a little wobbly. "What else can we do with our busy feet?" Benny wondered aloud.

"I know!" Ella said. "We can dance!"

So Benny and Ella started twirling, spinning, and wiggling their arms and legs in every direction. Benny’s feet tapped out a funny little rhythm as he twirled around. *Tap-tap-tap!* Ella's feet followed, and soon they were both dancing in the middle of the yard.

"Benny, your feet are so fast!" Ella laughed.

"They sure are! They don’t want to stop!" Benny danced and wiggled his feet faster and faster, feeling happier with each move. His feet felt like they were having a party!

After a while, Benny's other friends, Sam and Mia, joined in. "What are you two doing?" Sam asked.

"We’re giving our busy feet some exercise!" Benny said proudly.

"Exercise? That sounds cool!" Mia said.

"Come on! Let’s all run, jump, and dance together!" Benny shouted. The friends started running in a big circle, their feet pounding the ground. *Thump, thump, thump!* Then, they jumped as high as they could. *Boing, boing, boing!* Finally, they all danced, spinning and giggling, letting their feet move to the beat of their laughter.

Benny’s feet were getting tired, but he didn’t mind. He felt so good! His heart was beating fast, and he had a big smile on his face. "This exercise stuff is awesome!" Benny said, breathing hard.

Sam nodded, wiping sweat off his forehead. "Yeah! My feet feel happy!"

Mia giggled. "Mine too! Exercise is fun!"

Benny’s mom called from the porch. "Benny, it’s time to come inside."

Benny waved to his friends. "Let’s play again tomorrow, and we can give our feet even more exercise!"

His friends agreed and waved goodbye. Benny walked back inside, his busy feet finally feeling a little calmer. "Mom, you were right! Exercise is fun! My feet had the best time ever."

His mom smiled and gave him a big hug. "Exercise keeps you strong and happy, Benny."

Benny yawned. "And sleepy too," he said, as his busy feet slowed down and stopped wiggling.

That night, Benny’s feet didn’t wiggle at all. They were too tired from all the running, jumping, and dancing. As Benny drifted off to sleep, he thought about all the fun he had with his busy feet. He couldn’t wait to do it again tomorrow.

**Moral of the story:** Exercise keeps you strong and happy.
