**Mia’s Friendship Tree**

One sunny afternoon, Mia was playing in her backyard when she noticed a new family moving into the house next door. Excited, she ran to the fence and waved. A girl about her age looked up and smiled. Her name was Emma.

"Hi! I'm Mia! Do you want to play?" Mia called out.

Emma nodded. "Sure! I love making new friends."

Mia jumped up with excitement. “Come on over! I have something special we can do together!”

Curious, Emma climbed over the small fence and joined Mia in her yard. Mia pointed to a tiny sapling in a pot.

“This is our friendship tree,” Mia said proudly.

Emma looked confused. “A friendship tree?”

“Yes!” Mia said. “I got it from my grandma. She said if we plant it together and take care of it, our friendship will grow just like the tree.”

Emma smiled brightly. “That sounds fun! Let’s plant it!”

### The Friendship Tree Begins to Grow

The two girls found a perfect spot in the yard. They dug a little hole with their hands, giggling as the dirt squished between their fingers.

Mia carefully placed the tiny tree in the hole. “Now we need to water it!” she said.

Emma grabbed the watering can and gave the tree a good drink. “Grow, little tree, grow!” Emma sang, twirling around with joy.

Mia laughed and joined in, clapping her hands. “Grow, little tree, grow!”

After watering the tree, they both sat down to admire their work.

“Do you think it will grow fast?” Emma asked.

Mia shook her head. “Grandma says it takes time, just like our friendship. We have to take care of it, give it water, and make sure it has sunshine. That’s how it will grow strong.”

Emma thought for a moment. “Kind of like how we take care of each other?”

Mia nodded. “Exactly! If we share, play, and listen to each other, our friendship will grow bigger and stronger, too.”

### Days Turn into Fun

Each day after that, Mia and Emma met in the backyard to check on their tree. They took turns watering it, making sure it had plenty of sunlight. Sometimes, they sat by the tree and told stories, imagining the tree could hear them.

One day, while they were playing, Mia noticed something different.

“Look!” Mia shouted, pointing at the tree.

Emma rushed over. “What is it?”

“There’s a new leaf!” Mia said, her eyes wide with excitement.

Emma clapped her hands. “The tree is growing! Just like our friendship!”

The two friends danced around the tree, laughing and holding hands. “Grow, friendship tree, grow!” they chanted together.

### The Windy Day

One afternoon, the wind began to howl. The sky grew dark, and leaves swirled through the air. Mia and Emma rushed outside to check on their tree.

“Oh no!” Emma cried. “The wind is so strong! What if it blows our tree over?”

Mia’s heart raced. “We have to protect it!”

They grabbed some sticks and gently tied them to the tree to help it stand tall. Then they stood in front of it, arms out wide, like two little trees themselves, trying to block the wind.

As they stood there, shivering in the gusty air, Mia looked at Emma. “We’re protecting our friendship tree just like we protect each other.”

Emma smiled, even though her hair was blowing wildly in the wind. “Yeah, we’re good friends because we take care of each other.”

The wind howled and swirled, but the little tree stayed strong, thanks to Mia and Emma’s help.

### The Tree Grows Strong

Weeks passed, and the weather warmed up again. The friendship tree grew taller, and so did Mia and Emma’s friendship. They laughed together, shared their favorite games, and learned to listen when one of them was feeling sad.

One day, Mia’s grandma came to visit and noticed the tree. “My, my! Look at that strong little tree,” she said. “You two have taken such good care of it.”

Mia and Emma beamed with pride. “It’s our friendship tree,” Mia explained. “It grows because we take care of it, just like our friendship.”

Grandma smiled. “That’s a beautiful lesson. Friendships, just like trees, need love, care, and patience.”

### A Special Surprise

One morning, as Mia and Emma checked on their tree, they noticed something incredible.

“Look!” Mia gasped.

The tree had grown little buds, and soon they would bloom into flowers.

Emma’s eyes sparkled. “Our tree is blooming! It’s so beautiful!”

Mia nodded. “Just like our friendship. We’ve taken care of it, and now it’s grown into something special.”

They hugged each other and danced around the tree once more. “Grow, friendship tree, grow!”

As they twirled and laughed, they knew that just like their tree, their friendship would keep growing, as long as they cared for it.

### Moral of the Story:
Friendships grow when you take care of them, just like a tree needs water, sunshine, and love to grow strong and beautiful.

So remember, take care of your friends, be kind, and watch your friendships bloom!
