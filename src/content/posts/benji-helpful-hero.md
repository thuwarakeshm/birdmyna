**The Helpful Hero**

One sunny afternoon, Benji was playing in his yard when he noticed his neighbor, Mrs. Hazel, struggling with a big bag of groceries. Her arms were full, and she was moving slowly towards her front door.

“Oh no!” Benji said to himself. “It looks like Mrs. Hazel needs some help!”

He quickly ran over to her, his feet pattering on the ground. “Do you need a hand, Mrs. Hazel?” Benji asked with a big, friendly smile.

Mrs. Hazel looked down at Benji and sighed with relief. “Oh, Benji! That would be wonderful. This bag is very heavy, and I have more in the car!”

Benji nodded, feeling a bit like a superhero. “Don’t worry, Mrs. Hazel. I’m on the job!”

He grabbed the big bag of groceries, his small hands gripping the handles tightly. He wobbled a little as he carried it to her front porch, but he kept going. “This is nothing for a helpful hero like me!” he whispered to himself.

Once Benji set the bag down safely by the door, he raced back to Mrs. Hazel’s car. There were more bags! Some had apples peeking out, while others were stuffed with bread and boxes.

“Wow, Mrs. Hazel has enough food for a feast!” Benji thought, imagining a giant picnic with sandwiches as tall as trees and apples as big as his head.

He grabbed two more bags and slowly carried them back, his arms stretched out like he was flying. “Super Benji, off to save the day!” he said in his best superhero voice.

Mrs. Hazel chuckled. “Thank you, Benji. You’re so kind to help me!”

Benji grinned, feeling his heart warm up. Helping Mrs. Hazel made him feel proud, like he was doing something really important.

Once all the bags were inside, Mrs. Hazel clapped her hands. “You did it, Benji! You saved the day. I don’t know how I would have managed without you.”

Benji stood tall, puffing out his chest. “No problem at all! Helping others makes me feel like a hero.”

Just as he was about to leave, Mrs. Hazel called him back. “Wait a second, Benji. How about a little snack for my hero?”

Benji’s eyes widened. He hadn’t expected that! “A snack?” he asked, excited.

Mrs. Hazel went inside and returned with a big, shiny apple and a cookie. “For all your hard work, Super Benji,” she said, handing him the treats.

Benji took the apple and cookie, feeling even happier. He thanked Mrs. Hazel and ran back home, his feet skipping along the way.

As he sat on his porch, munching on the apple, he thought about how good it felt to help someone. “Being helpful is the best kind of hero,” Benji said with a smile. And from that day on, he looked for more ways to lend a hand.

Whether it was helping his mom clean up after dinner or carrying his friend's books at school, Benji made sure to be a helpful hero every chance he got. Because being a hero wasn’t about having superpowers—it was about being kind.

**Moral of the story**: Helping others makes you feel like a hero.
