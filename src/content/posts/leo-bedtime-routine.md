**Leo’s Bedtime Routine**

Once upon a time, there was a little lion named Leo who lived in a cozy forest with his family. Every day, Leo spent his time playing with his animal friends, exploring the tall trees, and running through the grassy fields. Leo loved his busy days, but sometimes, when the sun went down, he would feel a little tired and grumpy.

One evening, after a day of playing tag with his friends, Leo stomped into the house, feeling extra tired. "I don't want to go to bed yet," Leo said with a big yawn. His mom smiled and ruffled his fuzzy mane. "Leo, do you remember our bedtime routine?" she asked softly.

Leo thought for a moment. He knew he had a bedtime routine, but sometimes he just wanted to skip it and stay up late. But Mom always reminded him that the routine helped him sleep better and wake up feeling strong and ready for the next day.

"Let’s start with step one!" said Mom. Leo nodded slowly, already feeling a little better. Step one was always the same.

### Step One: Brush, Brush, Brush!

Leo padded to the bathroom and picked up his toothbrush. "Brush, brush, brush, get those teeth shiny and clean!" sang Leo’s mom. Leo giggled and brushed his teeth in front of the mirror, pretending he was a silly lion with sparkly teeth. 

Brush, brush, brush! He swished and swooshed until his teeth were squeaky clean. "Look, Mom! My teeth are shining brighter than the moon!" Leo said with a grin.

"Great job, Leo! Now it's time for step two."

### Step Two: Splash, Splash!

Step two was Leo’s favorite. He loved to wash his face. Leo turned on the water and splashed it onto his fur, feeling the cool drops tickle his nose. "Splash, splash, wash away the day!" Leo sang as he scrubbed his face with a soft cloth.

"All clean!" Leo said, shaking the water from his fur like a playful puppy.

Mom smiled. "Perfect, Leo! You’re ready for step three."

### Step Three: Snuggle into Pajamas

Next, Leo chose his favorite pajamas. They were soft and blue, with tiny stars all over them. He wiggled into them, feeling cozy and snug. "Now I feel like I’m wrapped in a blanket of stars!" Leo said as he twirled around.

"You're looking cozy, Leo!" said Mom. "Now for the last step."

### Step Four: Story Time!

Leo climbed into bed and snuggled under the covers. Mom sat beside him with a big book filled with stories about brave animals and magical forests. She opened the book and began to read. 

Leo's eyes grew wide as he listened. He loved hearing about the adventures of other animals, especially when they were brave and kind like him. His favorite part was always when the animals worked together to solve problems.

As the story went on, Leo's eyes started to droop. His big lion yawn stretched from ear to ear. The gentle sound of Mom’s voice and the soft words of the story made him feel safe and sleepy.

### The Sleepy Time Magic

"Time to close your eyes, Leo," whispered Mom, brushing his mane gently. "You followed your bedtime routine, and now it's time for sweet dreams."

Leo yawned again and pulled the covers up to his chin. "Goodnight, Mom. I feel ready for tomorrow now," he whispered with a sleepy smile.

And just like that, Leo fell into a peaceful sleep, dreaming of new adventures with his friends, climbing the tallest trees and racing through the soft, grassy fields. His bedtime routine had worked its magic once again, helping him feel rested and happy.

### The Next Morning

The next day, Leo woke up feeling great! His eyes were bright, his body felt strong, and he was ready for a whole new day of fun. He jumped out of bed, eager to run outside and play with his friends.

Mom smiled as she watched Leo. "See, Leo? A good bedtime routine always helps you feel your best."

Leo nodded happily. "I’m going to follow my routine every night! I want to feel this good every morning!"

And from that day on, Leo never skipped his bedtime routine. He brushed his teeth, washed his face, put on his pajamas, and listened to a story every night. And every morning, he woke up feeling rested, happy, and ready for a new adventure.
