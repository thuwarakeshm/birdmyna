**Emma's Smart Dollar**

Once upon a time, in a little town where the sun always seemed to shine, there lived a curious and cheerful girl named Emma. Emma loved exploring, playing outside, and asking lots of questions. But more than anything, she loved helping her friends.

One sunny morning, Emma’s mom gave her something special: a shiny, crinkly dollar bill.

"Here you go, Emma," her mom said with a smile. "You can spend this dollar however you like."

Emma’s eyes widened as she looked at the dollar. It felt like magic in her hands. She could already think of a hundred fun things she could buy! Should she buy candy? Maybe a toy? Or even a sparkly pencil for drawing!

She folded the dollar carefully and tucked it into her pocket, then skipped off down the street, eager to spend it.

As Emma wandered through town, she spotted her first temptation: the ice cream truck!

“Ring-a-ding, ring-a-ding!” the bell chimed as the truck parked right in front of her.

"Ohhh, ice cream!" Emma exclaimed, hopping on her tiptoes. "I love ice cream! And it’s a hot day!"

She reached into her pocket and pulled out her dollar. But just as she was about to hand it to the ice cream man, she stopped.

"Hmm," Emma thought aloud. "If I spend my dollar on ice cream, it will be gone in a few minutes. Maybe there’s something I can buy that will last a little longer."

So, Emma waved goodbye to the ice cream truck and continued down the road.

A few blocks later, Emma saw a toy store. The window was filled with colorful toys—robots, dolls, cars, and puzzles. Right in the middle, sitting on a shelf, was a bouncy ball, bigger than any Emma had ever seen!

"A bouncy ball!" Emma squealed. "I could play with that all day!"

She hurried into the store and rushed over to the ball. It was perfect. She squeezed it and felt how springy it was.

"This could be fun," Emma said, holding up her dollar.

But then, she paused again. "Wait a minute," Emma whispered. "What if I get tired of bouncing the ball? Then I’ll have spent my dollar, and I won’t have anything left."

She put the ball back on the shelf, gave it a gentle pat, and walked out of the store.

Now Emma was feeling a bit unsure. She really wanted to spend her dollar, but she didn’t want to waste it on something she wouldn’t enjoy for long.

As she walked down the street, deep in thought, she heard a voice call out.

"Hi, Emma!"

It was her best friend, Ben, sitting on the steps of his house. Next to him was a small lemonade stand with a sign that read: "Lemonade: 50 cents a cup!"
    
"Do you want some lemonade?" Ben asked with a big grin.

Emma smiled back. "Sure! Lemonade sounds great!"

She reached for her dollar, but then she had an idea.

“Wait, Ben," she said, her eyes lighting up. "How about this? If I give you my dollar, we can buy enough lemons to make more lemonade and share it with everyone in the neighborhood!"

Ben’s eyes sparkled. "That’s a great idea, Emma! We can make a lemonade stand together!"

So off they went to the store, Emma holding her precious dollar tightly. They bought lemons, sugar, and cups, and hurried back to set up their stand. Together, they squeezed the lemons, stirred the sugar, and poured the lemonade into the cups.

Soon, a line of friends and neighbors formed, all eager to try their refreshing lemonade.

"One cup for you, and one cup for you!" Emma said cheerfully as she handed out the lemonade.

Each person gave them fifty cents, and before long, Emma and Ben had more money than they started with!

"We’ve earned five dollars!" Ben said, counting the coins in his hand.

Emma’s eyes widened with excitement. "Wow! We spent my dollar wisely, and now we have even more! We can save so
